This is a repo containing R code for creating maps of primary production required to sustain global catch. In essence, taking fish out of the oceans is also taking out some of the primary productivity of the oceans. This leads to a concept called "primary productivity required", or PPR - the amount of primary productivity required to sustain fish stocks and thus catch. PPR is therefore one way of estimating the human footprint on the oceans as seen through the lens of catch. See the Sea Around Us methods for an in-depth methodology behind calculating PPR: http://www.seaaroundus.org/multinational-footprint-method/#_Toc422153962
